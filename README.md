## Key Points

- The 3-input NOR gate consists of *three PMOS transistors in parallel* (pull-up network) and *three NMOS transistors in series* (pull-down network).
- The output remains *high (1) only when all three inputs are low (0)*.
- CMOS implementation ensures *low power consumption* and *high-speed performance*, but increases transistor count and layout complexity.
- Simulation results confirm the expected NOR gate behavior under different input conditions.
